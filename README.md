This is partial source for some of the various oddities posted on [geekabouttown.com](https://geekabouttown.com/odditieis/). This code is an absolute mess, and it represents various stages of growth and change in my own life as a programmer over the last decade. It uses various technologies, but the core of it is based on jQuery, which I know is desperately out of date. (If you're starting out with something like this, you'll want to look at something more current, lol.)

Please note that *all* of this is excerpted from my larger CMS, so this won't do anything by itself. Once you've got your head around basic HTML and Javascript, hopefully you'll be able to figure out how it all would fit into the larger document. (If you like, you can take a look at the source on the live site to see how it all comes out.)
