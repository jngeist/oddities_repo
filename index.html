description: A collection of weird stuff I've made
---

Over time, I've done my fair share of weird stuff, mostly for [Kill Screen](http://killscreen.com). A lot of that weird stuff has broken in one website update or another, and from time to time I get asked about something I made on Twitter. The editors over at KS have given me permission to archive some of those things here, so I'll be posting them from time to time for posterity's sake (read: so I can stop feeling guilty about my Twitter mentions).
